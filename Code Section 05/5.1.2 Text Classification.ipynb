       "> according to hollywood movies made in last few decades , life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to a human being . \r\n",
       "even worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark , god-forsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience . \r\n",
       "on the other hand , it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america , because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view . \r\n",
       "this film is amarcord , 1974 comedy by famous italian director federico fellini , which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages , and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life . \r\n",
       "the film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense . \r\n",
       "instead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs , as well as series of local , often very colourful characters . \r\n",
       "although many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator , movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist , 14-year old boy titta ( played by bruno zanin ) and chronicles his sexual frustrations , obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca ( played by magali noel ) , problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family , as well as troubles his father ( played by armando brancia ) have with mussolini's fascist regime . \r\n",
       "amarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film , and it probably explains why it is very popular , even among those people who actually don't like federico fellini's work very much . \r\n",
       "every member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film , because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible . \r\n",
       "distortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film - word \" amarcord \" is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase \" i remember \" in local italian dialect . \r\n",
       "in the same way the word is distorted , so is the past in memories of those who remember it . \r\n",
       "after the premiere , fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film , but it doesn't matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellini's childhood or not ; any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film . \r\n",
       "fellini's views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film . \r\n",
       "even the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images . \r\n",
       "characters look like caricatures , actors playing them often deliberately overact , and women , especially those who fuel titta's sexual fantasies , often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions . \r\n",
       "every now and then , scenes that depict 1930s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movie's characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters' visions . \r\n",
       "because of that , almost everything in this film looks different , and in most cases better , than it would have looked in the real life . \r\n",
       "even the fascism gets fellinian make-over - fellini views mussolini's totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle ( explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history ) and opportunity for comedy . \r\n",
       "when fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents , even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour . \r\n",
       "unlike many of his italian colleagues in 1970s , who had used 1930s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda , fellini doesn't care that much about politics . \r\n",
       "lack of self-righteous moral perspective is compensated with fellini's humanistic approach to his characters . \r\n",
       "each of them , regardless of age , gender , social class or physical appearance , is given opportunity to express his or her views , dreams and fears . \r\n",
       "fellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection , even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people . \r\n",
       "because of this warmth and democratic spirit , amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of 20th century , and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable , melancholic and even tragic moments . \r\n",
       "fellini couldn't produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie . \r\n",
       "vignettes aren't memorable because of the characters only ; fellini uses camera , painting film in bright colours , especially in the scenes that depict character's fantasies . \r\n",
       "fellini also knows how to use locations , whether such location happens to be luxurious hotel , bright-coloured beach or rural countryside . \r\n",
       "even the down-to-earth streets of rimini , where everyone knows everyone , gets magical dimension during the snowfall . \r\n",
       "on the other hand , lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene . \r\n",
       "this atmosphere is also provided by incredible talent of composer and fellini's long-time associate nino rota . \r\n",
       "his amarcord theme is probably one of the most recognisable , most popular and most relaxing and uplifting pieces of film music ever produced . \r\n",
       "that music alone should be the reason to view amarcord as one of the indisputable classics of seventh art . \r\n"

       "not content with a traditional firefighting story , chris soth's screenplay attempts to jazz it up by having william forsythe from palookaville play a vicious killer named randy earl shaye who sets a forest fire so that he can join the crew to put it out and then escape . \r\n",
       " ( \" hoods in the woods , \" is what the \" ground-pounders \" yell out when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire . ) \r\n",
       "along the way , shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by suzy amis , who turns out to have been trained in warrior ways by her father , who was a marine drill instructor . \r\n",
       "most of the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing . \r\n",
       "he flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck . \r\n",
       "arguably the low point is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside . \r\n",
       "using a ramp , he shoots straight out of the top of the building's attic , and when he hits the ground , he just rides off in a cloud of dust . \r\n",
       "when the film isn't using some stock footage of actual forest fires , the simulated ones look hokey . \r\n",
       "editor jack hofstra cheapens the action even more by his use of burning flames in scene transitions . \r\n",
       "the ending , with its sick twists , manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie . \r\n",
       "perhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise i heard afterwards in the lobby , \" it's not as bad as some of the television sitcoms . \" \r\n",
       "firestorm runs mercifully just 1 : 29 . \r\n",
       "it is rated r for violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers . \r\n"
